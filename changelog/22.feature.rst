Pipelines now have access to caching.

* There's a cache(dictionary) shared among the whole pipeline where each of the ``collect``, ``process`` and ``forward`` executions can store and grab data from.
* Additionally, each of ``collect``, ``process`` and ``forward`` plugins in a pipeline execution have their own caching, not shared. Could be used to store state between executions.
